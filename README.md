# SleepVersusLifestyleAnalysis

Our team's inspiration for this project originated from our first project meeting, where we found ourselves half asleep, discussing our experience with poor sleep quality over the past few days. As we shared our struggles with sleep deprivation and its impact on that day's productivity and well-being, it became clear to us that sleep health was something we felt we knew less about. Motivated by our shared experience, we decided to use this opportunity to delve deeper into the relationship between sleep habits and overall health with the Data Science tools we'd learned in class! 

After some initial research, we reaffirmed the fact that sleep quality not only impacts our physical health but also influences the way we are mentally able to go about our days. We then narrowed down our research topic, deciding that our project should seek to explore how lifestyle factors, such as occupation and age, intersect with sleep patterns. We planned to parse through a dataset we found on Kaggle by using (1) data science techniques that we've learned in class, like data preprocessing and machine learning algorithms like logistic regression and KNN, and (2) through additional research that included reading scholarly articles about the topic. Combining these two techniques, we hope to shed light on the relationship between our everyday habits (or inherent lifestyles) and sleep quality.
